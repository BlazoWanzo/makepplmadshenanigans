Jujutsu Shenanigans - Player Farming & Combat Script (makepplmadshenanigans)

This script provides an efficient way to locate and engage opponents in the game. By entering the first three letters of a player's username or display name, the script identifies the target. However, the execution of attacks is still manual, requiring user input to perform moves.  

Key Features:
- Target Identification: Enter the first three letters of a playerâ€™s username or display name to select a target.  
- Manual Execution: The script does not automate attacks; the user must perform them manually.  
- PvP-Oriented: Designed primarily for combat interactions and strategic gameplay engagements.  

This script is intended for fun and engaging gameplay rather than full automation, ensuring that users remain actively involved in the combat process.
